# tag DRUPAL-6--1-3 : 27th June 2008. 
# ====================================

* Update README.txt and INSTALL.txt

# tag DRUPAL-6--1-0 : 16th April 2008. 
# ====================================

* Full upgrade to Drupal 6.

# tag DRUPAL-5--2-0 : 10th April 2008. 
# ====================================

* Fixed logic so that when a user is adding a node (/node/add/node_type), the user's theme is used if the node type is among the allowed ones.
* Added setting: which node types should use the users' theme? Beside 'blog', you can add any CCK or custom node type.
* Added setting: should a user profile page use the site's default theme, or the user's theme? 
* Added a setting page, for the three items listed above.
* 34360: separate the blog theme from the site theme. 
  A new perm is added: 'select different blog theme' which is in addition to the core perm 'select different theme'.
  Now the user has two theme settings: one for the whole site, one for his/her blog.
* Hook_menu was executed twice for lack of if $may_cache loop.
